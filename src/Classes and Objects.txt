A class is a blueprint

It specifies what kinds of objects can be instantiated from it

Individual objects are all created based on the same blueprints - they're instances of the same class

The states of individual objects, i.e. their attributes and methods, may all vary however

E.g. a car is an object, it has attributes, such as weight and color, and methods, such as drive and brake

An object's variables specify the internal state of the object

An object's methods specify what the object does
