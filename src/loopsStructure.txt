Let's stick to the following loop structure:




//Create variables needed for the loop

while (true) {
    // read input

    // end the loop -- break
 
    // check for invalid input -- continue

    // handle valid input
 }
  
// functionality to execute after the loop end





 The program is cleaner if things to be done after the loop ends, are placed outside of it.
